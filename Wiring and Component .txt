Diagram Wiring Notes
Here is a breakdown of the connections shown in the diagram, which match your Code 2.txt file.

1. Power (3S Battery):

Battery (+): Connects to the Arduino VIN pin (to power the Arduino) AND to the Vcc2 (Pin 8) of the L293D (to power the motors).

Battery (-): Connects to an Arduino GND pin. This is the common ground for the entire circuit.

2. L293D Motor Driver IC:

Logic Power: Vcc1 (Pin 16) connects to the Arduino's 5V pin.

Ground: Pins 4, 5, 12, and 13 are all connected to the common GND.

Left Motor (Motor 1):

Enable 1,2 (Pin 1) -> Arduino Pin 9 (leftMotorSpeed)

Input 1 (Pin 2) -> Arduino Pin 2 (leftMotor1)

Input 2 (Pin 7) -> Arduino Pin 3 (leftMotor2)

Output 1 (Pin 3) & Output 2 (Pin 6) -> Connect to the two terminals of the Left Motor.

Right Motor (Motor 2):

Enable 3,4 (Pin 9) -> Arduino Pin 10 (rightMotorSpeed)

Input 3 (Pin 10) -> Arduino Pin 4 (rightMotor1)

Input 4 (Pin 15) -> Arduino Pin 5 (rightMotor2)

Output 3 (Pin 11) & Output 4 (Pin 14) -> Connect to the two terminals of the Right Motor.

3. 8-Sensor Array:

VCC: Connects to Arduino 5V.

GND: Connects to common GND.

Sensor Pins (1-8):

Sensor 1 -> Arduino A0

Sensor 2 -> Arduino A1

Sensor 3 -> Arduino A2

Sensor 4 -> Arduino A3

Sensor 5 -> Arduino A4

Sensor 6 -> Arduino A5

Sensor 7 -> Arduino 11

Sensor 8 -> Arduino 12
